    <h2 class="intro">Hi  , I am Bhavika Goel . </h2>
    <p class="intro">You might be wondering why I created such a project.  So, the story goes like this. After learning frontend development, I was thinking about what kind of project should I create? After so much research I was still not convinced on what topic  my project should be based on. Then suddenly an idea popped up into my mind that why not create a frontend project on my hobbies. It will help me to accomplish my goal to create a project as well as it is  a good way to showcase them. Although I am not a pro in my hobbies and you might even laugh at some of my drawings(cause they are funny :D ).Still they are a good way to relax my mind . </p>
